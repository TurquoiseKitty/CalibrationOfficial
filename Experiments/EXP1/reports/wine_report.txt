On dataset: wine
We are training model: vanillaPred
With training X of size: (4408,11)
We are grid searching for the best LR and bat_size
After 0.02 hours of training
We get a few ideal choices for tuple (LR, bat_size)
	 (0.005, 100)
	 (0.01, 600)
we finally choose (0.01, 600) as the best hyperparameters
All configs are recorded into yaml files in the config directory
